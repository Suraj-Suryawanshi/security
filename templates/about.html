					<h1 class="text-dark">cs-Security</h1>
					<p>Digital communication witnesses a noticeable and continuous development
						in many applications in the Internet. Hence, secure communication sessions
						must be provided. The security of data transmitted across a global network
						has turned into a key factor on the network performance measures. So, the
						confidentiality and the integrity of data are needed to prevent eavesdroppers
						from accessing and using transmitted data. Steganography and Cryptography
						are two important techniques that are used to provide network security.
						The aim of this project is to develop a new approach to hiding a secret
						information in an image, by taking advantage of benefits of combining
						cryptography and steganography.</p>
					<br><br>
					<div>
						<h2 class="text-dark">Cryptography</h2>
						<p>
							Cryptography is the study of secure communications techniques that allow only the sender and
							intended recipient of a message to view its contents. The term is derived from the Greek
							word kryptos, which means hidden. It is closely associated to encryption, which is the act
							of scrambling ordinary text into what's known as ciphertext and then back again upon
							arrival. In addition, cryptography also covers the obfuscation of information in images
							using techniques such as microdots or merging. Ancient Egyptians were known to use these
							methods in complex hieroglyphics, and Roman Emperor Julius Caesar is credited with using one
							of the first modern ciphers.
							<br>
							When transmitting electronic data, the most common use of cryptography is to encrypt and
							decrypt email and other plain-text messages. The simplest method uses the symmetric or
							"secret key" system. Here, data is encrypted using a secret key, and then both the encoded
							message and secret key are sent to the recipient for decryption. The problem? If the message
							is intercepted, a third party has everything they need to decrypt and read the message. To
							address this issue, cryptologists devised the asymmetric or "public key" system. In this
							case, every user has two keys: one public and one private. Senders request the public key of
							their intended recipient, encrypt the message and send it along. When the message arrives,
							only the recipient's private key will decode it — meaning theft is of no use without the
							corresponding private key.
						</p>
						<h3>
							What problems does cryptography solve?
						</h3>
						<p>
							A secure system should provide several assurances such as confidentiality, integrity, and
							availability of data as well as authenticity and non-repudiation. When used correctly,
							crypto helps to provide these assurances. Cryptography can ensure the confidentiality and
							integrity of both data in transit as well as data at rest. It can also authenticate senders
							and recipients to one another and protect against repudiation.
							<br>
							Software systems often have multiple endpoints, typically multiple clients, and one or more
							back-end servers. These client/server communications take place over networks that cannot be
							trusted. Communication occurs over open, public networks such as the Internet, or private
							networks which may be compromised by external attackers or malicious insiders.
							<br>
							It can protect communications that traverse untrusted networks. There are two main types of
							attacks that an adversary may attempt to carry out on a network. Passive attacks involve an
							attacker simply listening on a network segment and attempting to read sensitive information
							as it travels. Passive attacks may be online (in which an attacker reads traffic in
							real-time) or offline (in which an attacker simply captures traffic in real-time and views
							it later—perhaps after spending some time decrypting it). Active attacks involve an attacker
							impersonating a client or server, intercepting communications in transit, and viewing and/or
							modifying the contents before passing them on to their intended destination (or dropping
							them entirely).
							<br>
							The confidentiality and integrity protections offered by cryptographic protocols such as
							SSL/TLS can protect communications from malicious eavesdropping and tampering. Authenticity
							protections provide assurance that users are actually communicating with the systems as
							intended. For example, are you sending your online banking password to your bank or someone
							else?

							It can also be used to protect data at rest. Data on a removable disk or in a database can
							be encrypted to prevent disclosure of sensitive data should the physical media be lost or
							stolen. In addition, it can also provide integrity protection of data at rest to detect
							malicious tampering.
						</p>
						<h3>
							What is the difference between symmetric and asymmetric cryptography?
						</h3>
						<p>
							With symmetric cryptography, the same key is used for both encryption and decryption. A
							sender and a recipient must already have a shared key that is known to both. Key
							distribution is a tricky problem and was the impetus for developing asymmetric cryptography.

							With asymmetric crypto, two different keys are used for encryption and decryption. Every
							user in an asymmetric cryptosystem has both a public key and a private key. The private key
							is kept secret at all times, but the public key may be freely distributed.
							<br>
							Data encrypted with a public key may only be decrypted with the corresponding private key.
							So, sending a message to John requires encrypting that message with John’s public key. Only
							John can decrypt the message, as only John has his private key. Any data encrypted with a
							private key can only be decrypted with the corresponding public key. Similarly, Jane could
							digitally sign a message with her private key, and anyone with Jane’s public key could
							decrypt the signed message and verify that it was in fact Jane who sent it.
							<br>
							Symmetric is generally very fast and ideal for encrypting large amounts of data (e.g., an
							entire disk partition or database). Asymmetric is much slower and can only encrypt pieces of
							data that are smaller than the key size (typically 2048 bits or smaller). Thus, asymmetric
							crypto is generally used to encrypt symmetric encryption keys which are then used to encrypt
							much larger blocks of data. For digital signatures, asymmetric crypto is generally used to
							encrypt the hashes of messages rather than entire messages.
							<br>
							A cryptosystem provides for managing cryptographic keys including generation, exchange,
							storage, use, revocation, and replacement of the keys.

					<div>
						<h2 class="text-dark">Steganography</h2>
						<p>
							Steganography is the use of various methods to hide information from unwanted eyes. In
							ancient times, steganography was mostly done physically.
							<br>
							The oldest documented case of steganography dates to 500 BC, in which Histiaeus, the ruler
							of Milteus, tattooed a message on the shaved head of one of his slaves and let the hair grow
							back. He then sent the slave to the Aristagoras, his son-in-law, who shaved the slave’s head
							again and revealed the message.
							<br>
							In the centuries that followed, more modern forms of steganography were invented, such as
							invisible inks. Today, steganography has moved to the digital world.
							<br>
							“Steganography by definition is the hiding of one file within another,” says Ira Winkler,
							lead security principal at Trustwave.
						</p>
						<h3>How does Steganography work ?</h3>
						<p>
							Steganography works by hiding information in a way that doesn’t arouse suspicion. One of the
							most popular techniques is 'least significant bit (LSB) steganography. In this type of
							steganography, the information hider embeds the secret information in the least significant
							bits of a media file.

							For instance, in an image file each pixel is comprised of three bytes of data corresponding
							to the colors red, green, and blue (some image formats allocate an additional fourth byte to
							transparency, or ‘alpha’).

							LSB steganography changes the last bit of each of those bytes to hide one bit of data. So,
							to hide one megabyte of data using this method, you’ll need an eight-megabyte image file.

							Since modifying the last bit of the pixel value doesn’t result in a visually perceptible
							change to the picture, a person viewing the original and the steganographically modified
							images won’t be able to tell the difference.

							The same scheme can be applied to other digital media (audio and video), where data is
							hidden in parts of the file that result in the least change to the audible or visual output.

							Another less popular steganography technique is the use of word or letter substitution.
							Here, the sender of the secret message hides the text by distributing it inside a much
							larger text, placing the words at specific intervals.

							While this substitution method is easy to use, it may also make the text look strange and
							out of place, since the secret words might not fit particularly well into their target
							sentences.

							There are other types of steganography, such as hiding an entire partition on a hard drive,
							or embedding data in the header section of files and network packets. The effectiveness of
							these methods depends on how much data they can hide and how easy they are to detect.
						</p>
						<h3>
							Least Significant Bit Steganography
						</h3>
						<p>
							We can describe a digital image as a finite set of digital values, called pixels. Pixels are
							the smallest individual element of an image, holding values that represent the brightness of
							a given color at any specific point. So we can think of an image as a matrix (or a
							two-dimensional array) of pixels which contains a fixed number of rows and columns.
							Least Significant Bit (LSB) is a technique in which the last bit of each pixel is modified
							and replaced with the secret message’s data bit.
							<img src="{%static 'images/steg.png' %}" alt="">
							<img src="{%static 'images/steg2.png' %}" alt="">
							<br>
							From the above image it is clear that, if we change MSB it will have a larger impact on the
							final value but if we change the LSB the impact on the final value is minimal, thus we use
							least significant bit steganography.
						</p>
						<h4>
							How LSB technique works?
						</h4>
						<p>
							Each pixel contains three values which are Red, Green, Blue, these values range from 0 to
							255, in other words, they are 8-bit values. [4] Let’s take an example of how this technique
							works, suppose you want to hide the message “hi” into a 4x4 image which has the following
							pixel values: <br><br>
							[(225, 12, 99), (155, 2, 50), (99, 51, 15), (15, 55, 22),(155, 61, 87), (63, 30, 17), (1,
							55, 19), (99, 81, 66),(219, 77, 91), (69, 39, 50), (18, 200, 33), (25, 54, 190)] <br>
							Using the ASCII Table, we can convert the secret message into decimal values and then into
							binary: 0110100 0110101.Now, we iterate over the pixel values one by one, after converting
							them to binary, we replace each least significant bit with that message bits sequentially
							(e.g 225 is 11100001, we replace the last bit, the bit in the right (1) with the first data
							bit (0) and so on).This will only modify the pixel values by +1 or -1 which is not
							noticeable at all. The resulting pixel values after performing LSBS is as shown below:
							<br><br>
							[(224, 13, 99),(154, 3, 50),(98, 50, 15),(15, 54, 23),(154, 61, 87),(63, 30, 17),(1, 55,
							19),(99, 81, 66),(219, 77, 91),(69, 39, 50),(18, 200, 33),(25, 54, 190)]
